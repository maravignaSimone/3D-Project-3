# 3D Object Detection with Transformers
This is the third and last project done for the 3D Perception, Learning-Based Data Fusion Course held at Univerisity of Parma.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to develop an object detection system for autonomous vehicles
operating in urban environments using the nuScenes dataset. Specifically, the system can
detect, localize and classify urban objects between 10 classes: car, truck, construction
vehicle, bus, trailer, barrier, motorcycle, bike, pedestrian, traffic-cone.
